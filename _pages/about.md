# QuTiBench
Neural Networks have become one of the most successful universal machine learning algorithms. 
They play a key role in enabling machine vision and speech recognition, and are increasingly 
adopted in other application domains. 
While the underlying computation is structurally simple, their computational complexity is enormous 
and comes along with equally challenging memory requirements both in regards to capacity and access bandwidth. 
This limits deployment in particular within energy constrained, embedded environments.  
In order to address these implementation challenges, a broad spectrum of new customized and heterogeneous 
hardware architectures have emerged, sometime referred to as deep learning processing units, 
often accompanied with co-designed algorithms to extract maximum benefit out of the hardware. 
Furthermore, numerous optimization techniques are being explored to reduce 
compute and memory requirements while maintaining accuracy.
This results in an abundance of algorithmic and architectural choices, some of which fit specific use cases 
better than others.  

For system level designers, there is currently no good way to compare the variety of hardware, algorithm and 
optimization options. While there are many benchmarking efforts in this field, they cover only subsections of 
the embedded design space.  None of the existing benchmarks support essential algorithmic optimizations such as 
quantization, an important technique to stay on chip, or specialized heterogeneous hardware architectures. 
We propose a novel benchmark suite, named QuTiBench, that addresses this need.  
QuTiBench is a novel multi-tiered benchmarking methodology that supports algorithmic optimizations such as 
quantization and helps system developers understand the benefits and limitations of these novel compute architectures 
in regards to specific neural networks and will help drive future innovation.  
We invite the community to contribute to QuTiBench in order to be able to support the full spectrum of choices 
in implementing machine learning systems.

Michaela Blott is the principal engineer at Xilinx Inc. She has more than 20 years of experience in FPGA and board-level design and networking. Her main areas of interest include data centers, high-level synthesis tools, and high-speed network processing on FPGAs. Asked about the biases that women in technology still confront, she says she faces less pressure to justify her existence in tech than to justify her decision to be a working mother.
