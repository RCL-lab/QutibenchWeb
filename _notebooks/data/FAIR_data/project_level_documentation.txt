1.For what purpose was the data created?
	Numerous algorithmic optimization techniques have been proposed to alleviate the computational complexity of convolutional neural networks. Given the broad selection of AI accelerators, it is not obvious which approach benefits from which optimization most. The design space includes a large number of deployment settings (batch sizes, power modes, etc.) and unclear measurement methods. This research provides clarity into this design space, leveraging a novel benchmarking approach. We provide a theoretical evaluation of different CNNs and hardware platforms, focusing on understanding the impact of pruning and quantization as primary optimization techniques. We benchmark across a spectrum of FPGA, GPU, TPU and VLIW processors for systematically pruned and quantized neural networks (ResNet50, GoogLeNetv1, MobileNetv1, a VGG derivative, a multilayer perceptron) over many deployment options, considering power, latency, and throughput at a specific accuracy. This dataset holds data from all measuremets done.
